# macOS Linux mode

All-in-one project to help you get PC-like experience on your maOS. Mostly for developers & other IT guys, but not only
ðŸ˜‰.

What you can get:
- PC keyboard shortcuts on your macOS, browser (chromium based) and IntelliJ
    - the configuration works for both PC and Mac keyboards in same time (there is a special device-checking rule)
    - there are no custom shortcuts - all of them would do exactly the same on Linux/Windows or almost (e.g. <kbd>
      Win</kbd>/<kbd>Option</kbd> key opens Spotlight while on Windows or Linux Mint would open Start Menu)
- Dock & built-in switcher replacement
- Basic window management

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Importing karabiner-elements rules

1. Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
2. Open Karabiner-Elements, create new profile (e.g. _Linux mode_) and select it:
<img src="./resources/karabiner-new-profile.png"/>

3. Open the following URL in your browser and allow the website to open Karabiner-Elements.app:

     ```
     karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxigan/macos-linux-mode/init/linux-mode.json
     ```

4. Click _Import_:

>Karabiner-Elements stores rules in under `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications` path. To tweak
> the rules update the json files there and enable the rules in _Complex modifications_ tab.

>Bear in mind that many of the configured shortcuts may clash with the system ones, so you may need to disable some of them in the system.

>Rules order is important, remember about it about tweaking the existing ones and adding your own. 
### Importing IntelliJ IDEA keymap

Importing Karabiner-Elements beforehand is required.
1. Install IntelliJ plugin [XWin Keymap](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13094-xwin-keymap) (it used to be preinstalled).
2. Copy [XWin IntelliJ.xml](https://github.com/raxigan/macos-linux-mode/blob/init/XWin%20IntelliJ.xml) file into the keymap configuration directory: `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2021.3/keymaps` (the path may differ).
3. Restart IntelliJ IDEA and go to Preferences â†’ Keymap and in the dropdown select *XWin IntelliJ* keymap.

> Some configured shortcuts cannot be changed in the IDE because of validation there. For such cases
> it's required to perform the tweaks directly in the keymap then restart IDE.

### Fixing <kbd>Home</kbd> & <kbd>End</kbd> keys

By default, macOS does not bind <kbd>Home</kbd> & <kbd>End</kbd> keys to any function. 
To make them to, respectively, move caret to beginning and end of line run the following command within
this project root directory (clone it first): 
```
mkdir ~/Library/KeyBindings && cp DefaultKeyBinding.dict ~/Library/KeyBindings
```

Then restart your Mac.

## Dock and Switcher replacement

There is no option to hide the Dock completely, so it's required to tweak its auto-hide configuration.

1. In macOS _System Preferences_ â†’ _Dock & Menu Bar_ enable _Automatically hide and show the Dock_.
2. Configure the Dock to show after 2 second (in case you really need) it by running this command in your terminal:
```
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 2; killall Dock
```

> To restare default Dock settings run the command:
> ```
> defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock
>```

3. Install [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/)

Example configuration:

<img src="./resources/alttab_controls.png"/>
<img src="./resources/alttab_appearance.png"/>

> To keep the AltTab list clean and short it's recommended to use
> the Blacklists feature to exclude less frequently used apps from it and/or
> the ones that can be easily accessed in some other way (e.g. Spotify, Docker Desktop etc.)

## Window management

Install [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/), then if you want to operate using <kbd>Win</kbd> and arrows you may want to set it up the following way: 

<img src="./resources/rectangle_settings.png"/>

> Before setting up Rectangle shortcuts select _Default_ profile in Karabiner-Elements, then set up the shortcuts
> and back to your custom profile again.
